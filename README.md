# Azure AI Foundry Transport

A comprehensive transport and logistics optimization platform built on Azure AI Foundry, designed to provide intelligent decision-making through advanced AI agents.

## Overview

This application enables intelligent transport management through:
- **AI-powered optimization** leveraging Azure AI Foundry and agents
- **Agentic knowledge with RAG** through Azure AI Search integration providing retrieval-augmented generation capabilities
- **Scalable MCP server** with Azure Container Apps
- **Enterprise-grade infrastructure** deployed on Azure


### Features

#### AI Agent Orchestration
- Azure AI Foundry Agent Service for intelligent decision-making
- Dynamic tool calling with MCP (Model Context Protocol) remote servers
- Multi-turn conversation management
- Transportation Operations MCP server for domain-specific tooling

#### Data Management
- Real-time data ingestion and processing
- Cosmos DB for distributed data storage
- Azure Storage for scalable blob and table storage
- Azure AI Search for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) providing agentic knowledge context

#### API Services
- FastMCP server providing dynamic tool definitions
- Container-based deployment on Azure Container Apps
- MCP protocol for agent tool integration

#### Monitoring & Observability
- Application Insights integration
- Log Analytics for centralized logging
- Performance monitoring and diagnostics
- Comprehensive audit trails

The solution is organized into modular components deployed via Infrastructure as Code (Bicep):

### Components

- **MCP Server**: FastMCP-based Transportation Operations server running on Container Apps
- **AI Services**: Azure AI Foundry Agent Service with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search (RAG) for agentic knowledge
- **Data Storage**: Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Storage for persistent data
- **Container Infrastructure**: Azure Container Apps for scalable deployment
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights and Log Analytics for observability
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault for secrets management and managed identities
